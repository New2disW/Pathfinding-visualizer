🧭 Advanced Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive and modern web app to visualize classic pathfinding algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra’s, and Breadth-First Search (BFS) — featuring real-time animations, weighted paths, maze generation, and smooth UI transitions.

🔗 Live Demo: https://new2disw.github.io/Pathfinding-visualizer/

🚀 Features

🧩 Algorithms Supported

A* Search Algorithm

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

🧱 Interactive Grid

Click and drag to create walls or weighted nodes.

Move Start and End nodes freely.

Watch the pathfinding algorithm animate step-by-step.

⚙️ Smart Controls

Toggle diagonal movement.

Choose between Wall and Weight draw modes.

Clear path or reset board with a single click.

🧠 AI-Powered Maze Generation

Uses a recursive division algorithm to generate random mazes automatically.

🎨 Beautiful UI

Dark theme with smooth animations, built with React and Babel (JSX) directly in the browser.

🧰 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, React (via CDN), Babel (for JSX)

Deployment: GitHub Pages (via GitHub Actions)
